Basically fully functioning gym progress tracker. This program allows you to track 6 different lifts with an option to skip (good if you don't do the same lifts every day), and tells you when to deload. 

Limitations: the rate of progression is hard coded to 5 for every lift, deloading is hard coded to a 10% reduction after 3 failed attempts to progress, & no ability to export data to something like excel.
